You are helping the user create a new feature specification interactively.

**Feature idea:** $ARGUMENTS

Walk through spec creation by asking questions one section at a time. After each answer, summarize what you captured and move to the next section.

## Process

1. **Clarify the feature** - Make sure you understand the core idea. Ask clarifying questions if the initial description is vague.

2. **Problem Statement** - Ask: "What problem does this solve? Why is it needed now?"

3. **Requirements** - Ask: "What are the must-have requirements? What would be nice-to-have but not essential?"

4. **Technical Constraints** - Ask: "Any technical preferences or constraints? (language, libraries, performance needs, things to avoid)"

5. **Open Questions** - Ask: "Any unresolved questions or decisions that need to be made later?"

6. **Review & Save** - Present the complete spec for review. Ask if any changes are needed. Once approved, save to `docs/specs/todo/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md` using today's date.

## Guidelines

- Keep questions focused and one section at a time
- Suggest reasonable defaults when the user isn't sure
- Use your knowledge to fill in obvious details (don't ask about things you can infer)
- Keep the final spec concise but complete
